Small Health System Using Engine
ðŸš€ Coding Challenge Accomplishment: Building a Small Health System in Unity!

ðŸŽ® Challenge Description:
I recently took on the challenge of building a small health system in Unity, featuring two game objects - the player and the enemy. The goal was to implement a dynamic health system where the player's health decreases upon colliding with the enemy. If the player's health reaches zero, the player object is destroyed.

ðŸ‘¾ Key Features:
âœ¨ Player movement implemented.
âœ¨ Collision detection between player and enemy.
âœ¨ Health system with decrement on collision.
âœ¨ Player destruction on reaching zero health

ðŸŒŸ Learning Points:
This project allowed me to enhance my skills in Unity game development, particularly in handling collisions, implementing player movement, and managing health systems. It was a great opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical scenario.

ðŸš§ Challenges Faced:
Describe any challenges you encountered during the implementation and how you overcame them.

ðŸŽ‰ Conclusion:
Excited to share the results of this coding challenge! It's a small step, but every step forward is a victory in the world of game development. Looking forward to more challenges and continuous improvement!
